# Phonebook Application

## Overview
The Phonebook Application is designed for storing and organizing contact information for people and businesses. It allows users to easily add, search, edit, and delete contacts while ensuring that the data remains private and secure. The application implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure for efficient contact management and supports multithreading for parallel execution of tasks, such as searching contacts.
